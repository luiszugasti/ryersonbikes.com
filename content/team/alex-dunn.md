I am in my second year of biomedical engineering at Ryerson University. Being
fairly new to the city, I have found great fun in the networks of trails
throughout Toronto. Whenever I'm not in the saddle, you will find me either
hiking the Bruce Trail or playing the banjo. I have experience in triathlon and
criterium racing, but can also appreciate a good social bike ride. Social rides
are the best way to have fun, get outdoors and meet new people. Hope to see you
soon!
