I am in my second year of Biomedical Engineering at Ryerson University. Being 
fairly new to the city I have found great fun in the networks of trails 
throughout Toronto. Whenever I'm not in the saddle, you will find me either 
hiking the Bruce Trail or playing the banjo. I have experience in triathlon and 
criterium racing, but can also appreciate a good social bike ride. Social rides 
are the best way to have fun, get outdoors and meet new people. Hope to see you 
soon!
