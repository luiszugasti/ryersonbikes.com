I'm a third-year nursing student at Ryerson. Since moving downtown, I've really come to appreciate cycling 
as a way to commute, exercise, and of course, meet new people on RUCC rides! Recently, I've also become a 
delivery courier where each shift teaches me more about the best ways to get around the city on two 
wheels. With one of my career interests being community health, I'm starting to get more involved in 
cycling advocacy with the aim of creating safer streets, healthier people, and a better environment. 
Outside of cycling, I also enjoy volunteering, gaming, and learning new languages :-)
