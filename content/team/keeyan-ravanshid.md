If bicycles were living beings, I'd have loved to be reincarnated as one in a
future life. Hopefully, I can keep riding for decades to come, and rejoice in
the feeling, unequaled by any other method of transportation, which is the
simple yet beautiful transfer of human power to torque on two wheels. I enjoy
riding with friends and in a competition/race, here and there. Most of all, 
cycling is a source of peace for me, a time to relax amidst an otherwise busy
schedule. Hopefully, I can ride with as many RUCC members as possible this year.
