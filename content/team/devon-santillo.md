I'm a recent graduate of Ryerson Biomedical Engineering. Born and raised in
downtown Toronto apartments. I began cycling purely as a method of transit to
avoid TTC costs, but soon picked up bike building and restoration as a hobby.
My entire fleet is hand built and customized from scavenged parts, donations
and police auctions. Recently, I've also become a shift-staffer at the Bike
Sauce DIY co-op, as well as a more active mountain biker/park rider. Outside of
cycling I work in construction and am currently consulting on Ryerson green roof
research. Other hobbies include tabletop & video gaming, mixology, 3D printing,
woodworking and sailing.
