I'm in my last year of Computer Engineering at Ryerson University. I love
biking, with a preference for riding in the rain. I like to talk about bikes,
coding, and Mexican food. I am a quite experienced rider, and cycle-commuter.
When I'm not at Ryerson you'll often find me in Farmers Markets or trying to
clean my bikes and swearing not to ride them again so they stay shining. And
then continuing to ride them.
