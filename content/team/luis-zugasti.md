I'm a "fifth" year computer engineering student at Ryerson. My main
discipline is road cycling, although I am now in cahoots with
mountain biking and trials (no trials bike yet though). I'm a big
BikeShare enthusiast as well (those bikes are indestructible).
Outside of the club, I am big on full stack development and meeting
new people at hackathons, conferences and more.
In my personal time I'll be in farmers markets, reading about data
bases and hunting down free food. And, of course, cleaning my
bikes.
