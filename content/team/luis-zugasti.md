I'm a recently graduated computer engineering student at Ryerson. Dang, that's a mouthful. My main discipline is road cycling, although I am now in cahoots with mountain biking and trials (no trials bike yet though). I'm a big BikeShare enthusiast as well (those bikes are indestructible). Outside of the club I am big on full stack development and meeting new people at hackathons, conferences and elsewhere. In my personal time I'll be in farmers markets, reading about data bases and hunting down free food. And, of course, cleaning my bikes.
