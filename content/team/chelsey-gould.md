I’m a fourth-year journalism student at Ryerson University. Being from a rural area, I’m more used to riding the hilly countryside, but I’m learning lots about navigating busy city streets. Other than cycling, you can find me reporting local stories, leading a Brownies unit and playing clarinet in the university concert band. I love talking about history, living in the Maritimes and the great outdoors. Rides have always been one of my favourite ways to de-stress and have fun; I look forward to meeting you on the next one!
