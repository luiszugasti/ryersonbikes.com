This route goes through the quaint Rosedale and Summerhill
neighbourhoods, including a pedestrian bridge crossing over CPR tracks,
and joins onto the Kay Gardner Beltine Trail at Mount Pleasant Cemetery,
where the trail becomes a nice gravel. It is suitable for cruisers or
road bikes with thicker wheels.

The route generally climbs uphill until Davisville. Enjoy a rewarding
descent flying down Mount Pleasant Road during your return.

At the north end of the trail you can also bike over to Marlee Ave. to
join onto the paved York Beltline Trail.

The Beltine Trail does [continue to loop south of the
cemetery](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?ie=UTF8&oe=UTF8&msa=0&dg=feature&mid=14QdDwbU2pzlua2zZvBD3C4CUv7k&ll=43.69307284971749%2C-79.38448423454928&z=15)
in conditions more suitable for mountain bikes.

Special notes: -After turning right onto Mount Pleasant Road headed
north, take a right into Mount Pleasant Cemetery and then a left. You
will be able to bike under the bridge and meet the entrance to the
Beltline Trail, bypassing traffic and stairs. This option is only
available when the cemetery is open. -The west lanes of Mount Pleasant
Road have some bumps until the main descent, where it becomes smooth.
The road is unprotected and can be busy during rush hour, but there are
two lanes and cars generally have space to pass. - When nearing the
bottom of the Mount Pleasant hill, make sure to shift down and prepare
to ascend quickly as the hill goes up. - Watch for pedestrians on the
Beltine Trail
