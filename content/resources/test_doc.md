I'm a fourth-year journalism student at Ryerson University. Being from a rural 
area, I'm more used to riding the hilly countryside, but I'm learning lots 
about navigating busy city streets. Often you can find me reporting local 
stories, leading a Brownies unit and playing clarinet in the university concert 
band. I love talking about history, living in the Maritimes and the great 
outdoors. Rides have always been one of my favourite ways to de-stress and have 
fun; I look forward to meeting you on the next one!
