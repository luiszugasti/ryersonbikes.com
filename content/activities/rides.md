For the Winter 2020 semester, we'll be holding different ride disciplines.
(17 Gould Street) at 9 a.m. on Saturdays. If you are a new rider, please sign the [online waiver](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_SQXZpJ8VWwdOoR24TNzH5SU0cQUqaH8j7kEnyIWXPkU8IQ/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1).

See below for our ride event types ([legend explained at the bottom of the page](#event-legend)):

# Casual, Gentle Rides (10-15/ND/L/3-4)

These rides are currently open for 10-15 km/h target pace, are three to
four hours in length, with a lunch/picnic in the middle.

We take a lot of pictures during these rides. Casual rides are generally
chill. Don't expect to set a speed record here.

Rides are no-drop (no rider left behind) and all bikes are welcome.

# Fitness Rides (15+/ND/NL/3-4)

Fitness rides are intended to improve the overall group pace and fitness
level. Thus, be ready to go out of your comfort zone at times. We'll ride
at a minimum 15 km/h pace for three to four hours, with some small res
stops/rally points.

During these rides, you'll be exposed to cycling mechanics such as
drafting, hand signalling, sprinting and more.

Rides are no-drop (no rider left behind) and all bikes are welcome. However,
to maintain the minimum pace with other riders, it is strongly advised
to bring a hybrid bike or road bike.

# Club Rides (20-25/ND/NL/3-4)

Club rides can be considered a faster pace fitness ride, with key changes.
Pace is at least 25 km/h on level ground, with sprints on hills.
During these rides, it is expected that you know how to ride with a group
and you will get to practice your overall cycling skill, including drafting,
positioning and more. Rides are planned to be three to four hours in length.

If you haven't tried a Club Ride before and are wondering whether it is right
for you, make sure to try a fitness ride. If you are consistently at the top
of the pack with low to moderate extersion, you'll be a shoe-in for a Club
ride.

Rides tend to last between 60 and 80 kilometers. A road bike is strongly
preferred; however, hybrid bikes have also made an entrance in these rides.

# Competitive Rides (25+/D/L/5-6)

Competitive rides are led by experienced Ryerson cyclists and tend to be
between five and six hours long. A high level of endurance is expected
and each ride ends with a food stop (you earned it!) at a predetermined
location.

These rides are generally half-day endeavours and we aim to complete 100km,
if not more. Rides are full drop, with many return points along the way.
A road bike is certainly the best option for these rides.

# Event Legend
------

There are four identifiers for each ride, to help you determine the best one
for you. Let's take the competitive rides, for example.

(25+/D/L/5-6)

## The first number/symbol is the average pace target.
Measured in kilometres per hour. In general, the higher the number, the more
physically demanding. The plus sign to the right denotes that this pace (25
km/hr) is minimum. Numbers without the plus sign denote a target pace (aka
a maximum pace).

## The first letter, D, means that this is a drop ride.
No drop is symbolized as ND. This means that if you lose the main group, the
next time you can catch them is at a rally point, otherwise, you are on your
own. For no-drop rides, the main group may break up into two groups of
differing speed, to ensure no one falls behind.

## The second letter, L, means that a lunch is planned sometime in the ride.
NL denotes no lunch is planned. A lunch, or a food break, generally means a
break will be taken during the ride or at the end to eat food and chat with
your fellow Ryerson cyclists. Chats about cycling are highly probable.

## The last set of numbers, 5-6, denotes the estimated hours the event takes.
In this case, it is five to six hours long, and only considers the time in
between the first pedal stroke and the moment everyone heads home.
