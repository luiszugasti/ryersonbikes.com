We host bi-weekly rides and usually meet at the Ryerson University Book Store
(17 Gould Street) at 9 AM. If you are a new rider, please arrive ten minutes
early to fill out our club waiver as well as get the briefing on our route.

# Casual, Gentle Rides (10-15/ND/L/3-4)

These rides are currently open for 10-15 km/h target pace, and are three to
four hours in length, with a lunch/picnic in the middle.

We take a lot of pictures during these rides and are generally chill and
outgoing. Don't expect to set a speed record here. 

Rides are no drop and virtually all bikes are welcome. Just bring all you need
(including a warm sweater in Autumn temperatures!) and enjoy the ride.

# Fitness Rides (15+/ND/NL/3-4)

New for the season are our Fitness Rides. We'll ride at a minimum 15 km/h pace
(dependent on the group's overall capability) for three to four hours, with
some small rest stops/rally points.

These rides are to help you develop your cycling skill and work up towards the
club and competitive rides, but everyone is welcome as long as they can keep up
with the group.

Rides are no drop and as always all bikes are welcome. Just bring all you need
(including a warm sweater in Autumn temperatures!) and enjoy the ride.

# Club Rides (20-25/ND/L/3-4)

Also new for the season is our classic club ride. **Yes, we're bringing this one
back**! We'll be aiming for 25 km/h pace on flats and will practice our overall
cycling skill, including drafting and teamwork positions. Rides will be three to
four hours in length. A road bike is preferred, however hybrid bikes have also
made an entrance in these rides.

If you are unsure if this kind of ride is right for you, contact our Supervisors
before hand with all your questions! These rides are no drop rides with few
rally points in between, however, we'll aim to ride tightly to conserve energy
and make it as far as possible.

Rides tend to last at least 70 kilometers depending on the route, and you'll
be working decently hard that you won't need that sweater!

# Competitive Rides (25+/D/L/5-6)

Our last new cycling discipline is the competitive ride. These rides are led by
experienced Ryerson cyclists and tend to be 4 to 5 hours long. A high level of
endurance is expected and each ride ends with lunch (you earned it!) at a 
predetermined location.

These rides are generally half day endeavours and the routes are at least
about 100 kilometers. There will be rally points and drop out points listed on
the ride route. A road bike is certainly the best option for these rides.

# Event Legend

There are four identifiers for each ride, to help you determine the best one
for you. Let's take the Competitive rides for example.

(25+/D/L/5-6)

### The first number/symbol is the average pace target.
Measured in kilometers per hour, the higher the number, in general the
tougher the ride.

### The first letter, D, means that this is a drop ride.
No drop is symbolized as ND. This means that if you lose the main group, the
next time you can catch them is at a rally point. For no drop rides, the main
group may break up into two groups of differing speed, to ensure no-one falls
behind.

### The second letter, L, means that a lunch is planned sometime in the ride.
NL denotes no lunch is planned. Lunch (Or more correct, food break) generally
means a break will be taken in between the ride or at the end of the ride to
eat food and chat with your fellow Ryerson Cyclists. Who doesn't love food?

### The last set of numbers, 5-6, denotes the estimated hours the event takes.
In this case, it is 5 to 6 hours long, and only considers the time in between 
the first pedal stroke and the moment everyone heads home.
