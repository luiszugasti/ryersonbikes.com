Fall 2019 was a success! During the semester, we held 10 rides ranging from Casual to Fitness. We hope you enjoyed riding with us and look forward to riding together in 2020.

For the Fall 2019 semester, we are holding bi-weekly rides starting from the Ryerson University Campus Store (17 Gould St.). Check out our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RUCycling/">Facebook page</a> and/or sign up for our newsletter for information on upcoming rides. 

For each ride:
- Check your inbox Friday evenings for a weather update.
- Bring a helmet, water and a snack.
- First-time riders should fill out the online waiver. We'll also have one
ready in case you forget.

# Where do you want to go next?
Let us know if you'd be interested in leading trips - more trip leaders 
means more rides! Shoot us an email if you're interested. 

# Are you an endurance rider?
Talks are in the works for a varsity endurance cycling team at Ryerson. 
The person leading this initiative needs to gather a list of potentially 
interested people. If competitive cycling sounds like your thing, let us know by
shooting us an email and we'll connect you!
