# Are you an endurance rider?

Talks are in the works for a varsity endurance cycling team at Ryerson. 
The person leading this initiative needs to gather a list of potentially 
interested people. If competitive cycling sounds like your thing, let us know by
shooting us an email and we'll connect you!

# Where do you want to go next?
Let us know if you'd be interested in leading trips - more trip leaders 
means more rides! ðŸš²ðŸš²ðŸš² Send us an email to our contact detail.
