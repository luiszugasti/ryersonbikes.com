Our Spring 2020 riding season is postponed â€” we are staying at home in order to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. We encourage you to keep active by riding solo!
Stay tuned to our social media and newsletter, where we'll post important updates.  

# Where do you want to go next?
Let us know if you'd be interested in leading trips - more trip leaders 
means more rides! Shoot us an email if you're interested.  

# Are you an endurance rider?
Talks are in the works for a varsity endurance cycling team at Ryerson. 
The person leading this initiative needs to gather a list of potentially 
interested people. If competitive cycling sounds like your thing, let us know by
shooting us an email and we'll connect you!
